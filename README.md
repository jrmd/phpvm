# phpvm

`phpvm` is a simple command-line tool for managing multiple PHP versions on macOS, built with Go.

## Requirements

*   **macOS**: This tool is designed for macOS environments.
*   **Homebrew**: `phpvm` relies on Homebrew for installing PHP versions. Ensure you have Homebrew installed.

## Installation

Using go cli
```
go install github.com/jrmd/phpvm
```

Using brew
```
brew tap jrmd/tools
brew install phpvm
```

## Configuration

To make `phpvm` available in your terminal, you need to add its binary directory to your `PATH` and set up shell completion.

Add the following lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.config/fish/config.fish`):

```bash
eval "$(phpvm completion <your_shell>)" # Replace <your_shell> with your shell (e.g., zsh, bash)
eval "$(phpvm env <your_shell>)"
```

After adding these lines, reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc # Or your shell config file
```
